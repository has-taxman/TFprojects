# Terraform examples on AWS (Amazon Web Services)
Terraform is used to create, manage, and update infrastructure resources such as physical machines, VMs, network switches, containers, and more. Almost any infrastructure type can be represented as a resource in Terraform.

In this repo, I've created some Terraform code examples on AWS (Amazon Web Services) based in the book Terraform: Up and Running by Yevgeniy Brikman.

Quick start
You must have an AWS (Amazon Web Services) account.

The code consists of Terraform examples using HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) on AWS (Amazon Web Services).

All the code is in the code folder.

For instructions on running the code, please consult the README in each folder.

This is the list of examples:
01-hello-world - Terraform "Hello, World": Example of how to deploy a single server on AWS (Amazon Web Services) using the shortest script.
02-one-webserver - Terraform Web Server: Example of how deploy a single web server on AWS (Amazon Web Services). The web server returns "Hello, World" for the URL / listening on port 8080.
