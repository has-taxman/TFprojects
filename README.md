# Terraform Examples on AWS (Amazon Web Services)

Terraform is a powerful tool used to create, manage, and update infrastructure resources such as physical machines, virtual machines, network switches, containers, and more. Almost any infrastructure type can be represented as a resource in Terraform.

This repository contains Terraform code examples for AWS (Amazon Web Services), inspired by the book **Terraform: Up and Running** by *Yevgeniy Brikman*.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- An **AWS account**
- **Terraform installed** on your machine

The examples are written using **HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)**.

All the code can be found inside the `code` folder.

For specific instructions on running each example, refer to the README file within each folder.

## 📁 List of Examples

1. **01-hello-world**  
   - A minimal "Hello, World" Terraform script that deploys a single server on AWS with the shortest possible configuration.

2. **02-one-webserver**  
   - A more advanced setup that deploys a web server on AWS, returning "Hello, World" at the root URL (`/`) while listening on port `8080`.

## 💡 Notes

- These examples aim to demonstrate basic Terraform principles on AWS and can be extended for more complex infrastructures.
- Always review your AWS costs — even simple examples may incur charges.

Happy provisioning! 🚀✨
